# Inhouse Counts by Location

## Report details

This report reports inhouse counts by location by counting check in transactions where item status prior to check in = Available and request queue size = 0 (meaning it wasn't scanned to fill a page request). 

Reporter can enter start and end dates.

Output is pretty simple. Two columns:

| inhouse\_count | location\_name |
|---|---|
| 218 | UMKC HSL General Collection |
